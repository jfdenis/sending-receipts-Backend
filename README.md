```

## npm install
You need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) in order to get nodejs and npm as well.

run in your terminal ```npm install``` to install all node modules that the applications needs to work.

Then you have to run ```npm start``` to start the service wich is on the port 3001 (you can change it).

If you want it as a development service run ```npm run dev ``` and you get the app in the same port.

Also if you want to put this project in production you only need to run  ```npm run build``` and node will createa folder called dist and this
folder has HTML and JavaScript files bundled and ready to deploy.

#### This is only the back-end...
